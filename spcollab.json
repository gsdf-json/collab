        "[Technical Proposal] (DESCRIPTION OF WHO WILL HELP CARRY OUT THE PROJECT/WHO YOUR  COLLABORATORS OR COACHES ARE) Description of their capability": "SVL Group is a unique group of companies specialised in cutting sheets, plate blanks and tubes and further processing of blanks.SVL Group capabilities include:Laser cutting: Laser cutting is a standard cutting method for most metals today. It results in a very precise cut, and the pieces can be finished by marking, stamping, or punching so that they will only need threading at a later stage. Precise and clean laser cutting in all further processing and assembly stages will speed up the process and help to produce good-quality end products inexpensively.Waterjet cutting: Waterjet cutting is suitable for nearly all materials. It does not cause deformation by high temperatures or other types of heat-related damage on the cut pieces. This method is also suitable for producing very complex shapes or small holes in thicker materials as well.Plasma cutting: Plasma cutting is based on melting a groove on the cut piece. The suitability of this method depends on the material. 3D cutting heads allow us to achieve straight cuts and demanding shaped gaskets, and our machines can pre-mark the pieces with places for holes, openings, or bending lines, for instance.Flame cutting: Traditional flame cutting with oxygen and propane is another method well suited for cutting ferrous metals into shapes. Our machinery can handle the cutting of even the most demanding edge bevels.We ensure excellent flame cutting quality by always shot-blast cleaning the sheets before cutting.Press brakes: We can also bend the pieces we cut, when necessary. We have the right machinery and expertise, whether you need pieces which require a high press force or smaller pieces which require high-accuracy processes.Laser tube cutting: Laser tube cutting machine make the production of tube and profile pieces easy and profitable. Flexible software ensure that raw materials are used economically and cutting is efficient We can cut pieces into finished products in one go, without the need of multiple setup work. The internal stress of tubes and profiles can be controlled best when they are cut by laser methods.",

DeFarmercist has a vision to partner with organizations implementing projects that accelerate the adoption of improved farming technologies to improve productivity, create jobs and enhance food security on the African continent.   In line with the objectives of OAK Foundation, DeFarmecist focus areas include developing crop production and management protocols in crop nutrition, pest control, and post-harvest technology for adapted greenhouses, as well other modern farming systems such as hydroponics and aquaponics. In addition, they are training experts in technical skills for managing modern farming systems and open fields that equips participants to set up their farm enterprises and provide the needed human resource for extension services. DeFarmercist’s capacity training expertise and capacity in modern farming systems are evident in the various projects they have implemented in the recent past. In the last two years, they have trained and mentored over 200 youth in modern farming systems, including vertical hydroponic Krakty and greenhouses across the country. They have provided agronomic services to 20 modern farms, mainly greenhouses, across Ghana. Currently, DeFarmercist agronomists serve as consultants for four greenhouse farms with a total cultivated area of 1.5 hectares. DeFarmercist’s demonstration and training greenhouse farms won the best farm in their district during the 2020 Farmers’ Day celebrations. Furthermore, DeFarmercist has demonstrated digital skills as a greenhouse vegetable influencer on social media; this will serve as an asset to the Green Enterprise Incubation project since that digital/online platform will be used to generate traffic for people to sign onto the OAK Foundation HELLO FRESH marketing platform when the members of this proposed project are brought on board.",

The training model was based on three unique elements focused on job creation, helping students as entrepreneurs and providing one-year post training support in Business Management.As current trends increasingly demand more than vocational skills, BI has responded with a richer array of liberal arts, business and digitaloriented programs designed to build critical thinking skills in students, broaden their social and cultural awareness, and better prepare them for the responsibilities of productive citizenship.BI after receiving accreditation from the Council for Technicaland Vocational Education and Training (COTVET) decided to run programs on the National Qualification Framework as per the COTVET Law Act 716 2006.Our Programmes include: MAKEUP ARTISTRY, COSMETOLOGY, COSMETIC SCIENCE, BEAUTY AND FASHION MARKETING. In 2022, we have trained about 177 people in Basic & Intermediate courses and 15 people in Advanced courses.",

Its mandate then was to train the youth in Vocational Agriculture to feed the Ministry of Agriculture and related organisations in the capacity of technical officers and Farm Assistants. Today, Wenchi Agric College is the youngest college in the country and continues to advance toward its vision to be among the best agricultural training delivery institutions in the country with a deep commitment to liberal learning, exceptional public affairs opportunities and outstanding professional programmes that serve the Bono, Ahafo and Bono East Regions and the country as a whole. The college is mandated to train personnel into technical agricultural officers for the agricultural sector. The current training is competency based in nature and it is aimed at ensuring that hands-on practical skills and competencies are acquired to making graduates job creators rather than job seekers in the agricultural sector.",
